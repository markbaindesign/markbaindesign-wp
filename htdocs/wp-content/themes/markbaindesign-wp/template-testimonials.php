		<blockquote><p>I have had the pleasure of working with Mark Bain on a number of projects. His ingenuity has contributed enormously to the success of <a href="http://localhost/portfolio1.0/portfolio/lessonstream-org/">Lessonstream.org</a>, an online resource for teachers that I set up in 2011. As well as being a highly-creative designer and problem solver, Mark pays very close attention to establishing and maintaining effective communication between client and developer. Through constant consultation, Mark was able to elicit my goals and nurture a website with the perfect balance between function and design.</p></blockquote>

		<blockquote><p>Everywhere I've been in my teacher training work, from Bangkok to Buenos Aires, people have said to me how much they liked my websites <a href="http://sixthings.net">www.sixthings.net</a> and <a href="http://the-round.com">www.the-round.com</a>. A large part of this is down to Mark Bain's work on design. One thing that sets Mark apart from other designers I've worked with is that with Mark really knows how to listen. Mark has helped me develop my ideas and goals into attractive and functional web sites. In doing so, he added something else too, his own flair for cool design. Most importantly, he has explained every step of the process whenever I've had questions. I would not hesitate in recommending Mark Bain for any design work.</p></blockquote>

		<blockquote><p>Mark combines visual wit and style with a willingness to listen. This is is invaluable when discussing potential and ongoing work&mdash;and it's a quality that doesn't always come with the creative territory. Perhaps it's because he's a teacher as well as a designer&mdash;he asks what you want, outlines the options that may be available and doesn't just talk you through a rate card. His work is consistently excellent&mdash;functional but cool as fuck.</p></blockquote>

Mark asks what you want and is excellent at eliciting your objectives. Then he gives you the possible options, and explains every step of the process. He is always willing to listen and is fantastic at establishing effective communication. This willingness to listen, and the ability to find the perfect balance between design and functionality are what sets him apart from other designers. Mark is a joy to work with. I would recommend Mark for any kind of design project without any hesitation.</p></blockquote>
